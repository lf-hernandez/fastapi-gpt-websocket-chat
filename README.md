# ü¶¶ fastapi-gpt-websocket-http-stream-chat ü¶¶

A Proof of Concept (PoC) that leverages websockets and HTTP streaming to relay OpenAI's GPT chat completions in real-time using the FastAPI framework. While FastAPI is used here, any API framework supporting websockets and HTTP streaming can be adapted for this purpose.

## Local Development Setup üõ†

If you prefer to set up your local environment without using Docker, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

   **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

2. **Install the Dependencies**:

   Ensure you're inside the project directory and your virtual environment is activated.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   This will start the FastAPI application with hot-reloading enabled. You can access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Docker Deployment üê≥

### Production Setup üöÄ

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

    From the project root, execute:

    ```bash
    docker build -t app .
    ```

2. **Run the Container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 app
    ```

    The application will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`.

### Development Setup üíª

FastAPI development is made smoother with hot-reloading. I have added a dedicated `Dockerfile.dev` for this.

1. **Build the Development Image:**

    From the project root, execute:

    ```bash
    docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t app-dev .
    ```

2. **Run the Container with Volume Mount:**

    This mounts the current project directory to the container, allowing you to observe changes in real-time:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd):/app app-dev
    ```

    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. Any source code modifications will instantly reflect in the application.
